DynaWin - Dynamic Desktop for Windows 10 and Windows 11

## About DynaWin

DynaWin is a utility that allows the Windows desktop to change dynamically.

## Before you install...
To run on startup, DynaWin creates a batch script in the user's startup folder. However, some antiviruses may flag this as unsafe. If this is the case, please add DynaWin and the batch script, located at **<code>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start&nbsp;Menu\Programs\Startup\StartDynaWin.bat</code>** to your antivirus's exclusions list.
     
Some antiviruses and/or firewalls may block DynaWin from accessing the internet, causing the auto-update system to not work. In this case, please add DynaWin to your firewall's or antivrus's exclusion list.

## Features

### Dynamic Theme:
Switch your Windows theme or app theme based on time.

#### Automatic theme switching

DynaWin can automatically switch the Windows theme at specific timings. For example, you can automatically switch Windows to Dark theme at night, so that it is easier on the eyes.

#### Choose which mode to switch
You can configure DynaWin to switch only the app or system theme, or both. This gives you more control over DynaWin's behaviour and allows DynaWin to better cater to your needs.

### Dynamic Wallpaper
Switch your desktop wallpaper at certain triggers.

#### Automatic switching of desktop wallpaper
DynaWin can automatically switch your wallpaper at specific triggers. For example, you can configure DynaWin to switch your wallpaper at night, to make it easier on the eyes.

#### Choose when your wallpaper should be changed
DynaWin can change your wallpaper either based on the time, or based on your battery percentage, to remind you when your battery is running low, or remind you to unplug your charger.

### Automatic Updates
DynaWin also automatically notifies you when there is a new update. This is to ensure that you have the latest version of DynaWin at all times so that you can have the latest features available.

## Compatibility
DynaWin works with Windows 10 and Windows 11. I have not tested if DynaWin works with Windows 8.1 or Windows 7, so if you are on those versions of Windows, use at your own risk. DynaWin also requires .NET framework version 4.8 to function properly.
