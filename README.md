DynaWin - Dynamic Desktop for Windows 10

## About DynaWin

DynaWin is a utility that allows the Windows desktop to change dynamically.

## Before you install...
DynaWin has a feature that allows the user to configure it to run on Windows startup. DynaWin does this by creating a batch script that starts DynaWin and placing said batch script in the user's startup folder. However, some antiviruses may flag this batch script as unsafe. If this is the case, please add DynaWin and the batch script  (which is usually located at "C:\Users <username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\StartDynaWin.bat") to your antivirus's exclusions list.

Furthermore, some antiviruses and/or firewalls may block DynaWin from accessing the internet, causing the auto-update system to not work. In this case, please add DynaWin to your firewall's or antivrus's exclusion list.

## Features

### Dynamic Theme:

#### Automatic switching of theme

You can configure DynaWin to automatically switch the theme at specified timings. 
For example, you can automatically switch Windows to Dark theme, so that it is easier on the eyes when working at night.

#### Choose which mode to switch
You can configure DynaWin to only switch the app or system theme. This allows DynaWin to better cater to your needs.

### Dynamic Wallpaper

#### Automatic switching of desktop wallpaper
You can configure DynaWin to automatically switch your wallpaper at specific triggers.
For example, you can configure DynaWin to switch your wallpaper at night, to make it easier while working at night. You can even configure DynaWin to change your wallpaper when your battery is running low, to give you a quick reminder before your battery runs out of power.

#### Choose when your wallpaper should be changed
In addition to changing your wallpaper based on the time, you can also change your wallpaper when your battery percentage is at a certain level. This is useful as it can remind you when your battery is running low, or remind you to unplug your laptop charger when it is fully charged

### Automatic Updates
DynaWin also automatically notifies you when there is a new update. This is to ensure that you have the latest version of DynaWin at all times so that you can have the latest features available.

## Compatibility
DynaWin works with Windows 10. I have not tested if DynaWin works with Windows 8 or Windows 7, so if you are on those versions of Windows, use at your own risk. DynaWin also requires .NET framework version 4.8 to function properly.
